# YAKET: Yaml Keras Trainer (or Yet Another Keras Trainer)

## Project status
Work In Progress. 

## Description
Yaket is a lightweight and simple module to train Keras modules by defining parameters directly using YAML file. YAML parameters are validated using Pydantic, hence typos or not allowed parameters will throw errors at the beginning of the execution.
This allows developer to focus uniquely on what matters: data and model development.
By having parameters defined in a human-readable format, it is possible to have an holistic view of training procedure without opening the code.
Morevoer, Data Scientists and ML Engineer won't need to add manually all training parameters, such as optimizer, callbacks, schedulers, thus reducing the
likelihood of human-induced code bugs.

## Badges
