# YAKET: Yaml Keras Trainer (or Yet Another Keras Trainer)

## Project status
Work In Progress. 

## Description
Yaket is a lightweight and simple module to train Keras modules by defining parameters directly using YAML file.
This allows developer to focus uniquely on what matters: data and model development.
By having parameters defined in a human-readable format, it is possible to have an holistic view of training procedure without opening the code.
Morevoer, Data Scientists and ML Engineer won't need to add manually all training parameters, such as optimizer, callbacks, schedulers, thus reducing the
likelihood of human-induced code bugs.

## Badges
TODO: Tests are not covering the code YET.

## Visuals


## Installation
    pip install yaket

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.
